# About

Memory Blocks is a tile-matching puzzle game that consists of an array of randomly dealt tiles with their pictures side down.

Tiles can be fipped over by clicking on any two of them. If the tiles match (they have identical pictures), they will be removed.

The goal is to clear the table by matching tiles with the same picture, two by two.
